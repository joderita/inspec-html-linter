# When:
#  * an html file contains the 'img' element
#  * and it doesn't contain the 'alt' text
#  *   Then the control should fail
#  *   Then the failure message should include 'This image doesn't comply with WCAG standards'


# you can also use plain tests
describe file('/tmp') do
  it { should be_directory }
